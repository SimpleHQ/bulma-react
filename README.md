## hiromi

Named so because of the original voice actress of Bulma in Dragonball, [Hiromi Tsuru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiromi_Tsuru)

React components for Bulma.

It's still in the early stages of development and is subject to breaking changes.

To run the docs:

`npm run docs`

To build the production files:

`npm run build`

### helpers

Every component has a bunch of helper properties attached to them. Note that some of these properties may not effect the style. We made this a default for all components as it allows for less duplication as well as the ability to cover all helpers for all components. Also, Bulma does not give a detailed list of which element has what modifiers. For the full list of modifier classes, go [here](http://bulma.io/documentation/modifiers/syntax/).
